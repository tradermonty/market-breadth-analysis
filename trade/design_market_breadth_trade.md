# Market Breadth Trader Design Document

## Overview

This program is a trading bot that automatically executes stock trades based on the overall market strength (Market Breadth) of S&P500 stocks, using moving averages, trends, and signal detection. It performs actual trades using the Alpaca API, with flexible parameter adjustments for signal detection and trading logic.

---

## Key Features

- S&P500 stock price data acquisition (EODHD, Alpaca)
- Market Breadth Index calculation
- Moving average calculation (short/long term, EMA/SMA selectable)
- Trend determination (with hysteresis)
- Signal detection (bottom/peak/background color changes)
- Automated trading based on signals (via Alpaca API)
- Stop loss and trailing stop support
- Log output and progress display

## Signal Logic

### Data Period
- Signal detection period is set to 2 years
  - Ensures sufficient data (approximately 400 days) for 200MA calculation
  - Enables accurate bottom and peak detection
  - Balances between data requirements and computational efficiency

### Signal Detection Mechanism

The signal detection process works as follows:

1. **Data Processing Period**
   - Processes data from 2 years ago to present
   - Ensures sufficient historical data for moving average calculations
   - Maintains computational efficiency by limiting the data range

2. **Execution Timing**
   - Signal detection is performed during the last 20 minutes before market close
   - This timing ensures:
     - Market movements for the day are mostly complete
     - More reliable signals can be generated with confirmed price data
     - Signals can be prepared for the next trading day
     - Avoids high volatility periods during market hours
   - The `is_closing_time_range(range_minutes)` method is used to determine the appropriate timing
   - This approach helps reduce false signals and improves signal reliability

3. **Past 20-Day Analysis**
   - When a bottom is detected, looks back 20 days from that date
   - Calculates minimum Market Breadth value for those 20 days
   - Uses the exact date range relative to the detected bottom

4. **Signal Generation**
   - Records the date when a bottom/peak is first detected as the signal date
   - Executes trades only when the signal date matches the current date

5. **Signal Conditions**
   - **Short MA Bottom**: 
     - 8MA below threshold
     - Past 20-day Breadth minimum (from bottom date) below 0.3
   - **Long MA Bottom**: 
     - 200MA below threshold
     - Past 20-day Breadth minimum (from bottom date) below 0.5
   - **Long MA Peak**: 
     - 200MA above 0.5 and peak detected

**Key:**
- ðŸ”´ Day 3: Actual Bottom
- ðŸŸ¢ Day 5: Signal Detection & Entry

1. **Real-time Detection Approach**
   - Instead of using the actual bottom or peak dates directly as signals
   - Analyzes historical data sequentially and generates signals when bottoms or peaks are detected
   - This means the actual bottoms or peaks are already in the past when signals are generated

2. **Detection Process**
   - Analyzes data sequentially in chronological order
   - Detects bottom and peak patterns from historical data
   - Generates signals at the detection point (actual bottoms or peaks occurred on previous dates)
   - **Time Lag Consideration**: 
     - Peaks and bottoms require time to be confirmed
     - Signals are generated only after sufficient data confirms the pattern
     - This lag ensures more reliable signal generation but means trading slightly after the actual bottom/peak

3. **Advantages**
   - Enables real-time trading decisions
   - Generates reliable signals based on historical data
   - Reduces the risk of false signals
   - Provides confirmation of market reversals before entry

## Trading Rules

- Entry/Exit on signal days
- Entry uses half or full capital

### Backtest Results Example

![Backtest Results Sample](../reports/backtest_results_sample.png)

The above image shows a sample backtest result for the Market Breadth Trader. The chart displays:

1. **Price Chart (Top Panel)**
   - Blue line: Actual price movement
   - Green/Red markers: Buy/Sell signals
   - Yellow line: Trailing stop level (when enabled)

2. **Market Breadth Index (Middle Panel)**
   - Blue line: Market Breadth Index
   - Red line: Short-term moving average (8-day)
   - Green line: Long-term moving average (200-day)
   - Gray background: Market trend (white for bullish, pink for bearish)

3. **Position Size (Bottom Panel)**
   - Green bars: Long positions
   - Red bars: Short positions
   - Gray line: Cash position

The system generates buy signals when:
- Market Breadth Index crosses above the short-term MA (short-term bottom)
- Market Breadth Index crosses above the long-term MA (long-term bottom)
- Background color changes from pink to white (trend reversal)

Sell signals are generated when:
- Market Breadth Index crosses below the short-term MA
- Market Breadth Index crosses below the long-term MA
- Background color changes from white to pink
- Stop loss or trailing stop is triggered

## Extension/Customization Points

- Adjust signal detection logic thresholds and periods
- Change trading symbols
- Add trading rules (split trading, multiple signal combinations, etc.)
